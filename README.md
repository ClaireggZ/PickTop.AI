## Project structure

`chrome-extension/` contains the frontend (chrome extension) that you see in the demo.

`nextjs-api/` contains some test endpoints that were **not** used in the demo. It was just used while developing the frontend. In the demo, Arvind's real system was used. This directory also contains some leftover webpages from before we changed it to a Chrome extension, and those can also be ignored.

## Design system

[Mantine](https://mantine.dev/) is the design system.
